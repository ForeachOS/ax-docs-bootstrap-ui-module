= Static elements
include::{partialsdir}/_attributes.adoc[]

A `StaticFormElement` writes a `<p>` tag with the class "form-control-static" to the output.

== Element and builder

The `StaticFormElement` implementation has no builder because of it's simplicity.

== Examples

Given the following builder configuration

[source,java,indent=0]
----
		StaticFormElement staticFormElement = new StaticFormElement();
		staticFormElement.setText( "Static text" );
----

The following markup would be rendered:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<p class="form-control-static">Static text</p>
----
