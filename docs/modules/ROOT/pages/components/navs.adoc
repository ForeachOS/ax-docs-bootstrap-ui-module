[[NavComponentBuilder]]
= Rendering menus
The `BootstrapUiComponentFactory` provides several builders for generating markup based on an Across `Menu`.
All builders extend `NavComponentBuilder` and support some of the same options.

|===

|Builder class
|Factory method
|Description

|`DefaultNavComponentBuilder`

== Example
=== An example of generating a nav structure from a `Menu`.

                <li><a href="#" title="Sub item 2">Sub item 2</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</nav>

=== Supported nav styles
You can generate specific nav structures using the `DefaultNavComponentBuilder` by specifying a nav style.

|Remarks

|`simple()`
|
|Default mode.

|`navbar()`
|_navbar-nav_

|_nav-tabs_

|

|`stacked()`

|===

All `NavComponentBuilder` implementations also support custom HTML attributes to be configured directly on the root element.

==== Default menu conversion behaviour
When mapping a `Menu` onto a nav, the following rules are followed:

* only 3 levels of items/groups are supported in the `Menu`
* an item is always rendered as a single item, even if it has children
* an item or group are only rendered if they are not disabled
* when an item is selected, the item itself as well as all its parent will have the _active_ css class
* a group is only rendered if it has at least one non-disabled child
* a group is rendered as a dropdown
* a group inside a group is rendered as a labeled section in the dropdown
* a group having only a single item is rendered as that single item unless the attribute _nav:keepAsGroup_ is set

==== Menu item title
All nav related builders support message code snippets in `Menu` titles.

Putting for example _#{my.code=Item title}_ as `title` property will be replaced by the `Locale` specific message for _my.code_ or by _Item title_ if that message code can't be resolved

==== Replacing group label by the selected item
By default the label of a dropdown will always be the title of the group.
If you want the label to be replaced by the label of the selected item, you should configure the `NavComponentBuilder` with `replaceGroupBySelectedItem`.

With `replaceGroupBySelectedItem` `true`, if no item is selected in the group, the dropdown label will still be the title of the group.
If an item is selected however, the dropdown label will be the item label, unless the group itself has the attribute _nav:keepGroupItem_ set to `true`.

==== Customizing nav rendering through the Menu
You can influence the generated output by setting reserved attributes on the `Menu` items.

NOTE: Attribute names mentioned here are available as constants on the `NavComponentBuilder` class.

The following attributes are support on `Menu` items:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|_nav:icon_
|`ViewElement` or `ViewElementBuilder` to be prepended to the item text.

|_nav:iconOnly_
|Only applicable on a group.
If an icon is set, this will render the group itself as only the icon.

|_nav:linkViewElement_
|`ViewElement` or `ViewElementBuilder` to use when rendering the link inside the list item.
This will replace the standard link with the element generated.
Note that any value for *nav:icon* will be ignored.

Possible child items will still be rendered as a nested unordered list if the item is a group.
A custom link should handle opening the dropdown in that case.

|_nav:itemViewElement_
|`ViewElement` or `ViewElementBuilder` to use for rendering the entire list item of that `Menu`.
The `ViewElement` should take care of the full rendering, including any possible children.

|_nav:keepAsGroup_
|Only applicable on a group.
If set to `true` the group will always be rendered as a group, even though there is only a single item in it.

|_nav:keepGroupItem_
|Only applicable on a group and if `replaceGroupBySelectedItem` is set to `true`.
If so and _nav:keepGroupItem_ is set to true, the replace action will be suppressed and the group label will always be rendered.

*NOTE*: Attribute is only relevant for a `DefaultNavComponentBuilder`.

|_nav:panelStyle_
|Holds the CSS class that determines the panel styling.
If set, the default _panel-default_ class will be omitted.
Only applicable on group menu items that would result in a panel being rendered.

*NOTE*: Attribute is only relevant for a `PanelsNavComponentBuilder`.

|_nav:renderAsPanel_
|If set to _false_ on an group menu item that would be rendered as a panel (a group on the top level), no panel will be rendered but a sidebar nav list will directly be rendered.
Optionally a title will still be included if the group has one.  Non-panel lists do not support groups as items, these will be ignored.

*NOTE*: Attribute is only relevant for a `PanelsNavComponentBuilder`.

|_html:*_
|Any attribute with a name starting with _html:_ will be added as html attribute to the list item.
Name of the html attribute will be the menu attribute name without the _html:_ prefix.

|===

===== ViewElementBuilder attribute values
Some attributes support a `ViewElementBuilder`.
When rendering using a `ViewElementBuilder` the `ViewElementBuilderContext` will have an attribute *NavComponentBuilder.currentMenuItem* that contains the `Menu` the builder is rendering.


==== Examples
===== Adding an icon
Adding an icon to an item or group is easily done by setting the _nav:icon_ attribute with a `ViewElement` or `ViewElementBuilder` value.

.Example adding an icon as attribute
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
menu.item( "/dl", "Download", "#" )
    .attribute( NavComponentBuilder.ATTR_ICON, new GlyphIcon( GlyphIcon.DOWNLOAD ) )
    .order( 1 );
----

===== An icon based dropdown
If you set attribute _nav:iconOnly_ to `true`, the dropdown will only render the icon for the group.
If there is no icon value set on the group item, the dropdown will render the group title.

The children of the group (dropdown options) will always be rendered as full items.

If however the dropdown label is replaced by an item or the group only contains a single item, the item will also be rendered as only an icon.

.Example creating a dropdown represented by a single icon
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
menu.group( "/options", "Options", "#" )
    .attribute( NavComponentBuilder.ATTR_ICON, new GlyphIcon( GlyphIcon.COG ) )
    .attribute( NavComponentBuilder.ATTR_ICON_ONLY, true )
    .and()
    .item( "/options/dl", "Download", "#" )
    .attribute( NavComponentBuilder.ATTR_ICON, new GlyphIcon( GlyphIcon.DOWNLOAD ) );
----
