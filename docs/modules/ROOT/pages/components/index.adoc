= Default elements
include::{partialsdir}/_attributes.adoc[]

Most default elements can be created through the `BootstrapViewElements.bootstrap` static facade.

== Overview
Although elements can be created directly, most have an equivalent `ViewElementBuilder`.
The builder implementation is rarely created directly but through short-hand `BootstrapViewElements.bootstrap.builders` methods.

See the javadoc for more information about the available methods.
